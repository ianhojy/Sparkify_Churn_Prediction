## 1. Business Problem <a id="problem">

### Defining Churn <a id="churn">

> **Customer churn** is a tendency of customers to abandon a brand and stop being a paying client of a particular business. The percentage of customers that discontinue using a companyâ€™s products or services during a particular time period is called a customer churn (attrition) rate.

#### Churn in Sparkify Context

For this project, we will define **churn** as when a user cancels the service. In the dataset, this is identified as having a value of ```Cancellation Confirmation``` under column ```page```.

### Why is Chunrn a problem? <a id="why">

Churn is a problem for Sparkify as it represents revenue lost from subscribers who leave the platform. There is revenue lost from subscribers who previously paid for the subscription. There is also revenue lost from free subscribers since there is less to be made through others revenue streams such as advertisement.

Thus, the challenge is to identify these potential churn users before they actually cancel their subscription, and to employ appropriate countermeasure to prevent churn.
